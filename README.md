## Sudoku Puzzle Solver GUI Application

This is a simple Sudoku puzzle solver GUI application built using wxPython, a Python wrapper for the wxWidgets toolkit. The application allows users to play Sudoku puzzles by entering numbers into a grid. It includes features such as:

- Interactive grid interface for entering Sudoku puzzle numbers.
- Keyboard navigation for moving between cells using arrow keys.
- Real-time validation to ensure that entered numbers are valid for Sudoku puzzles.
- Congratulatory message displayed when the puzzle is solved.
- Randomly generated Sudoku puzzles for endless gameplay.

This project serves as a fun way to practice solving Sudoku puzzles while also demonstrating the capabilities of wxPython for building desktop GUI applications.
